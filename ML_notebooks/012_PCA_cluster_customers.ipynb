In this investigation we want to find if there are any natural groups of customers in my dataset.  The first step is to just get the data in a format we can feed to our machine learning models. Once we do that, then our boss (some dude named Gilad), said he will teach us how to cluster the customers! But it turns out you need to have the _data_ formatted in some special way...?

The first column is titled \"first_name\" and it seems to be the first name of each customer. Is this a usable feature? Well... not exactly in string format. So I guess I could one hot encode them into binary vectors, but even then... do I want to cluster the customers based on their first name? You can imagine some situation where clustering by name might be relevant (for example trying to guess what generation someone belonged to?) but in this case it seems like it's more of a unique identifier so it may be best to simply remove it. If every value in a column is unique (there are no duplications of the value) then we shouldn't use it as a feature because it will have a 1-1 mapping with the target variable which is not something we ever want. We want our model to learn and generalize from the features, not memorize that the name \"jane\" bought 5 cans of soda.\n",

    "## Calculate the Silhouette Score\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform the silhouette score we need the labels (that's pretty easy they are given to us), however we should _exclude_ the -1's because they represent points that are _not_ in a cluster. So they are basically discarded. We should probably collect those somewhere and else and see how large that number is. But it should not be part of the silhouette core.\n",
    "\n",
    "So\n",
    "1. seperate out the points which have the label `-1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then after we have done that, we can calcluate the silhouette score easily. \n",
    "#### NOTE\n",
    "DBscan in scikit-learn is implemented with the notion of \"core samples\".  From the [documentation:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#dbscan)\n",
    ">More formally, we define a core sample as being a sample in the dataset such that there exist min_samples other samples within a distance of eps, which are defined as neighbors of the core sample. This tells us that the core sample is in a dense area of the vector space. A cluster is a set of core samples that can be built by recursively taking a core sample, finding all of its neighbors that are core samples, finding all of their neighbors that are core samples, and so on. **A cluster also has a set of non-core samples, which are samples that are neighbors of a core sample in the cluster but are not themselves core samples.** Intuitively, these samples are on the fringes of a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the attributes `components` and `core_sample_indices` will only return core samples, for us to get all the points _within_ the cluster we will have to rely on the labels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of clusters?\n",
    "But what about the # of clusters? How many did we find and how many in each cluster? We need to examine the labels again, but this time count the unique ones and also count how many of each unique we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Run our little line of code, which gives both the score and # of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
